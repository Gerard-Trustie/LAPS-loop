# LAPSloop Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** September 30, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Development  
**Owner:** Trustie Technology Ltd

---

## Executive Summary

LAPSloop is an AI-powered product discovery and validation platform that automates the entire user research pipeline—from identifying pain points to shipping validated features. By implementing the LAPS framework (Listen, Analyse, Prioritise, Ship), LAPSloop enables product teams to make data-driven decisions based on validated user pain signals rather than assumptions.

**The Problem:** Product teams waste months building features users don't want because they lack systematic processes for validating user pain before development.

**The Solution:** An end-to-end platform that generates Mom Test-compliant interview questions, deploys user research surveys, analyzes responses for pain signals, quantifies market opportunity, generates UI mockups, validates solutions, and produces developer-ready specifications—all with AI assistance and statistical rigor.

**Primary Use Case:** Trustie will use LAPSloop internally to validate Money Moods, AI Money Mentors, and Savings Goals features. If successful, LAPSloop becomes a standalone B2B SaaS product.

---

## Product Vision

### Mission Statement
Eliminate product development waste by ensuring every feature is built on validated user pain signals, not assumptions.

### Vision (12 Months)
LAPSloop becomes the industry-standard tool for early-stage startups and product teams to validate product-market fit, replacing expensive consultants and time-consuming manual research with AI-powered automation.

### Core Values
- **Scientific Rigor:** Statistical significance matters
- **Bias Elimination:** Mom Test principles are non-negotiable
- **Speed:** Validation in days, not months
- **Transparency:** Show confidence intervals and reasoning
- **Learning:** Every validation cycle improves the AI

## The LAPS Framework

### L - Listen (Pain Discovery)
**Objective:** Uncover real user pain through unbiased questioning

**Process:**
1. User defines target audience and problem hypothesis
2. AI generates 8-10 Mom Test-compliant interview questions
3. AI Critic reviews questions for bias and hypothetical language
4. Iterate until questions pass Mom Test validation (>80% score)
5. Deploy survey to target audience via Prolific or manual distribution

**Success Criteria:**
- Questions focus on past behavior, not future intent
- Questions dig for specific stories and emotional reactions
- Zero hypothetical or leading questions
- >80% Mom Test compliance score

---

### A - Analyse (Pain Signal Detection)
**Objective:** Determine if pain signal is real or noise

**Process:**
1. Collect minimum 30-50 responses
2. AI analyzes open-ended responses using NLP
3. Calculate pain frequency, intensity, and emotional resonance
4. Perform statistical significance testing
5. Generate confidence intervals
6. Decision: Strong Signal / Weak Signal / No Signal

**Output Metrics:**
- **Pain Frequency:** % of users experiencing this pain
- **Pain Intensity:** Emotional language analysis (frustration, stress, etc.)
- **Current Solutions:** What users do today
- **Willingness to Change:** Evidence of active solution-seeking
- **Statistical Confidence:** Margin of error, sample size adequacy

**Decision Framework:**
- **Strong Signal (>70% frequency, high intensity)** → Proceed to Quantification
- **Weak Signal (40-70% frequency, medium intensity)** → Iterate questions or increase sample
- **No Signal (<40% frequency, low intensity)** → Pivot problem hypothesis

---

### A - Analyse (Pain Quantification - Reach & Impact)
**Objective:** Quantify market opportunity and pain severity

**Process:**
1. AI designs second survey with closed-ended questions
2. Measure frequency of pain occurrence (daily/weekly/monthly)
3. Calculate time/money cost of current workarounds
4. Assess willingness to pay indicators
5. Deploy to same or expanded audience (50-100 responses)

**Output Metrics:**
- **Reach:** How many people have this pain?
- **Impact:** How severe is it (time/money/emotional cost)?
- **Market Size:** Rough TAM calculation
- **Urgency:** How actively are users seeking solutions?

---

### P - Prioritise (Feature Ideation & RICE Scoring)
**Objective:** Generate solution concepts and prioritize by potential impact

**Process:**
1. AI analyzes pain signal + reach/impact data
2. Generates 3-5 potential solution approaches
3. Calculates RICE scores (Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort)
4. Creates user stories and success metrics
5. AI generates UI mockups/wireframes for top solutions
6. Creates A/B test variations

**RICE Formula:**
```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: # users affected per time period
Impact: Massive (3), High (2), Medium (1), Low (0.5)
Confidence: High (100%), Medium (80%), Low (50%)
Effort: Person-months of development work
```

**Output:**
- Ranked list of solution approaches
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Low-fidelity mockups/wireframes
- A/B test variations
- Estimated development effort

---

### P - Prioritise (Solution Validation)
**Objective:** Validate which solution approach resonates most

**Process:**
1. Show mockups to same audience (or expanded sample)
2. Measure solution-problem fit perception
3. Capture usage intent and preference
4. A/B test different approaches
5. Calculate preference scores and statistical significance

**Output Metrics:**
- **Problem-Solution Fit:** Does this solve your pain? (1-10 scale)
- **Intent to Use:** Would you use this? (Definitely/Probably/Maybe/No)
- **Preference Rankings:** A vs B vs C approaches
- **Feature Requests:** What's missing?

---

### S - Ship (Development Handoff)
**Objective:** Create developer-ready specifications with success metrics

**Process:**
1. AI generates comprehensive PRD
2. Includes user stories with acceptance criteria
3. Specifies instrumentation requirements
4. Defines success metrics and KPIs
5. Creates A/B testing framework
6. Generates Jira/Linear tickets

**PRD Contents:**
- **Problem Statement:** Validated pain signal summary
- **User Stories:** "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific, measurable requirements
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Feature adoption rate (target: >60%)

## Appendix

### Mom Test Principles Reference
1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
3. Talk less and listen more
4. Ask for commitment and advancement, not compliments
5. Avoid bad data through leading questions

### Statistical Significance Guidelines
- Minimum sample size: 30-50 for qualitative insights
- Confidence level: 95% for feature decisions
- Margin of error: <10% for go/no-go decisions
- Effect size: Cohen's d >0.5 for "strong signal"

### RICE Scoring Reference
```
Reach: # of users affected per time period (e.g., 1000/quarter)
Impact: Massive (3), High (2), Medium (1), Low (0.5), Minimal (0.25)
Confidence: High (100%), Medium (80%), Low (50%)
Effort: Person-months (e.g., 2 PM for backend work)

Example:
Reach: 1000 users/quarter
Impact: 2 (High)
Confidence: 80%
Effort: 3 person-months

RICE = (1000 × 2 × 0.8) / 3 = 533
```
